Forests and nåså's, Python, text based rpg

This is my first "big" project after learning some basic python programming.

It is a text based rpg game.

State of the game: It works end to end, but there are most likely some minor bugs here and there.

Note that numbers related to combat and xp haven't been properly tweaked yet. They are relatively basic so that testing is easier to manage.
